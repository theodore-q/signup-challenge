# Tray.io multi-step signup form

A responsive SPA multipage sign up form.

## Getting Started

To install dependencies run in the project directory:

```
yarn install 
```

To run the dev sever, in the project directory run:

```
yarn start
```

This runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Running the tests

```
yarn test
```

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Running the build

```
yarn build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Notes:

If I were to make improvments I would:
 * Add PropTypes or write the whole thing in typscript.
 * Make the password rules list update to ticks when each requirement is met.
 * Added more tests
 * Added more scss variables
 * Not imported foundation for the CSS
